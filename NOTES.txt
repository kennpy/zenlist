How tasks will work

send to db and receive in same FORMAT
when we receive a task its a list of tasks
we parse that and loop through adding to page
when we make a new task we do the same but 
    1. swap the grid element with input with the grid element we are just about to make with the task
    2. Add task row, add input row, delete first input row (1+2+3 -> X+1+2)
    3. Keep the input below the grid so whenever we add a row we push it down
    4. Keep input in grid but always add row before input so it constantly gets pushed down

 - when a user shifts we get the input and append it to the corresponding grid  
    /. 

 - if we are out of range we dont shift
